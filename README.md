- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikosKoumbakis.
- 👀 I’m interested in large systems, small buttons, and what happens when you press them.
- 🧭 I have a fondness for improbable plans that somehow work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to herd abstractions without alarming them.
- 🛠️ I enjoy turning vague ideas into something that almost exists.
- 🧠 I spend a lot of time thinking about thinking, and occasionally writing it down.
- 💞️ I enjoy projects that start as terrible ideas and end with everyone pretending it was the plan.
- 🪐 I believe everything is simple once you understand it, which may take some time.
- 📫 How to reach me: leave a note in the margins, or shout gently into the void.
- 🧪 Known to run experiments on curiosity and see what ships.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak fluent emoji, plain English, and whatever that was just now.
